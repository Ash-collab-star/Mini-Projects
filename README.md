1. Tic Tac Toe:
   Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os.
   It is typically played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their symbol (either "X" or "O").
   The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
